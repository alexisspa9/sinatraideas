### Gemfile and environment.rb

This project is supported by Bundler and includes a `Gemfile`.

Run bundle install before getting started on the project.

As this project has quite a few files, an `environment.rb` is included that loads all the code in your project along with Bundler. You do not ever need to edit this file. When you see require_relative `../config/environment`, that is how your environment and code are loaded.
